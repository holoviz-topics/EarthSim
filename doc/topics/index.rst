The `User Guide <../user_guide/>`_ has examples focusing on the ``earthsim`` code,
whereas these notebooks show case studies and in-depth examples of specific workflows and
research topics.  So far, the examples mostly use the
`GSSHA <http://www.gsshawiki.com/>`_ simulator, but other examples using
`AdH <http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476708/adaptive-hydraulics-model-system/>`_ are being developed and will be added here when they are ready.

EarthSim is an open-source project, but note that the GSSHA simulator
used in these examples (and included in the earthsim environment) is
freely available but closed source.
