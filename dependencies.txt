########## indirect deps ##########
conda-forge::scikit-image=0.14.0 # from datashader; have not verified we need to pin this (though it does contain compiled code)
conda-forge::descartes=1.1.0     # from geopandas; have not verified we need to pin this
conda-forge::nodejs=9.11.1       # for bokeh (not a dep of bokeh conda package)
conda-forge::boost-cpp=1.66.0    # current c-f pin (used by various deps including filigree)

# Newer x264 breaks current c-f::opencv (3.4.1; see
# https://github.com/conda-forge/opencv-feedstock/issues/115). Note
# that the windows package is just a dummy (can't express optional
# constraint here). Alternatively could have asked users to create a
# pinned file, or could have added "constrains" to e.g. our own copy
# of the opencv package, or could have a separate dependencies.txt
# file for windows.
pyviz/label/earthsim::x264

# zeromq: build 3 of 4.2.5 broke travis/linux (build 2 was fine);
# previous minor releases I tried were also problematic on
# linux. Appears to be going through some building changes right now
# on c-f, so temporarily avoid that by hosting ourselves.
